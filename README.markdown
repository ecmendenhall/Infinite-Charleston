This page, inspired by [Infinite Drunk Ron Swanson](http://drunkronswanson.com/), presents an infinite loop of the [Pete & Trudy Campbell Charleston](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7NLF6eNXNc) from "Mad Men." Now with seven different dances!

I built this to practice JavaScript and learn about HTML5 audio and video elements. A live version is available [here](http://ecmendenhall.github.com/Infinite-Charleston/).
